### BINGE
Binge is a TV show tracking application. It allows users to follow and save their tv shows as well as receive real-time analytics of their tv browsing habits.
​
​
# PURPOSE
We built this application to allow users to gain visibility on what shows they are watching, how much progress they have made for each show, and the pertinent information about each show. In the age when streaming has dominated the viewer industry, we realized it would be very engaging to allow users to gain access to their own streaming data. Users typically follow more than one show on Netflix, and it is a common occurrence for those shows to get lost. Binge fills in those gaps allowing users to keep track of their shows and their own progress so they never leave tv show behind. Binge ensures users are getting their money's worth out of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu so that they never forget a TV show again.
